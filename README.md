# RockPaperScissors

Everyone loves the Rock Paper Scissors (RPS) game.  In this project, I used Google Firebase for user authentication as well as the real-time aspect of the game.  The game features a real-time chat feature for all your trash talking needs!


Basic useful feature list:

 * Sign-in using email or your Google login
 * Send the link to another player
 * Wait for the player to join
 * To chat, simply type in the provided box and press 'send')
 * Game on!
